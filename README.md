A thorough mix of automated and manual testing have gone into building the project. In addition to tests, I have validated all files against online validation sites, and checked compatibilities across various modern browsers and devices.

### Validation services

-I used [This HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure my code was legal.
    - The only warnings were when the validator failed to recognise the Django template tags.
-I used [This CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure my CSS was legal.
